##### The unexpected hanging paradox:

The warden tells a prisoner on death row that he will be executed on some day in the following week (last possible day is Friday) at noon,
and that he will be surprised when he gets hanged. 
The prisoner realizes that he will not be hanged on Friday, because that being the last possible day, he would see it coming.
It follows that Thursday is effectively the last day that he can be hanged, but by the same reasoning,
he would then be unsurprised to be hanged on Thursday, and Wednesday is the last day he can be hanged.
He follows this reasoning, 
all the way back and realizes that he cannot be hanged any day that week at noon without him knowing it in advance. 
The hangman comes for him on Wednesday, and he is surprised.

    Create an algorithm to predict when the prisoner will be hang and list the highly likely day they will be hang.
